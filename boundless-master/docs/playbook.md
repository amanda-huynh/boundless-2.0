# Grassroots Innovation Program Playbook

We set out to leverage open source principles within the company with the goal to make the workplace more fun and engaging. In the pursuit of this goal, it also transformed us into a “Grassroots Innovation” driven culture. “Grassroots” means empowering ALL employees at ALL levels. Although we staff a formal research department, we obtained an additional boost by embracing the open source principles (e.g., “scratch and itch”, "peer recoginition", ...) that enabled all employees to participate.  And while the loin share of the innovations are software based, the results go beyond source code. “Innovation” means value creation that impacts all facets of the business including new: product features (hadware and software), customer/tradeshwo demos, tools (software, spreadsheets), tech reports, and processes to name a few. The value creation and cultural shift has been impactful and the ROI has been measurable. Yours can be too.

## Why create a Grassroots Innovation Program

Companies leverage open source practices internally for different reasons: some use it to drive product development; some seek to foster greater collaboration; while others may wish to create a more open source aware culture.  Our initial motive was to attract and retain talent by making the workplace more fun and engaging. Think of it as running a 24/7 hack-a-thon with lots of visibility.  In addition to achieving our goal, it also transformed our company into a “Grassroots Innovation” driven culture. Although we staff a formal research department, we obtained an additional boost by embracing the open source “scratch and itch” principle that empowers ALL employees at ALL levels. The value creation and cultural shift has been impactful and the ROI has been measurable.
